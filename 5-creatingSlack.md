# Creating Your Own Class Slack Workspace

Slack offers both free and paid versions of their service, and I use the free version for my classes. The free version offers most of the functionality I need, but there are some limitations. Foremost among those is the fact that you are limited to a total of 10,000 messages across the workspace. That may sound like more than you'll ever need--but it includes every private message, every group message, and every message posted by an integrated app. In a large group, or one with active discussions, you can easily hit that 10K message cap before the end of the term--and after that, messages "scroll off the top" in terms of access. (Older messages are preserved in the database, but are inaccessible if you don't upgrade to the paid version.) Additionally, the free version won't allow you to integrate with your organization's authentication server, so students need to create their own usernames and passwords for access--meaning one more login that they need to keep track of. 

While the ability to access older messages, view better analytics, and use single sign-on is attractive, Slack's pricing model makes the paid version unworkable for most educators. Even with Slack's extremely generous 85% educational discount, the cost of the service is $12 per user annually--and that's for use of a single workspace. If you belong to more than one Slack workspace, each counts as a separate "user". That pricing model works well in businesses, where departments and teams tend to have a set number of employees. It can even work in an educational environment if you have a small, set number of students each year. But for those of us teaching 60-90 different students each term, it's not a viable option. 

The good news is that those limitations haven't significantly impacted Slack's usefulness in my classrooms. 

Slack provides a very good [Getting started for workspace creators](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/217626298-Getting-started-for-workspace-creators) guide, which walks you through the specifics of setting up a new Slack workspace.

Once your workspace has been created, I suggest going back to the [Using Slack](3-usingSlack.md) page to review the ways I've customized my Slack workspace for use in classroom settings.
